## Tic-Tac-Toe ##
#### Learning - ReactNative ####

This is an old project specifically made to practice using [ReactNative](https://reactnative.dev/) and state management in a mobile application.

#### App Description ####

This app emulates a tic-tac-toe game. It builds a board and keeps track of the state of each move. Each turn the user can make a play or reset the board to any previous turn. After each turn, the board is evaluated for possible winning patterns. Message is shown to indicate the current player or winner/stalemate.
